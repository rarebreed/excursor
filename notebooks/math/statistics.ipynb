    "probabilities.  Basically we count all the times we see a certain event divided by the total times we looked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayesian\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way is to interpret them in the Bayesian model.  We can look at probabilities as uncertainty of events, and \n",
    "reflect on our knowledge of the world/system.  It does not need to be based on repeated trials.  Imagine if you were\n",
    "asked \"What are odds it rained in Tulsa On Jan 10th?\".  You can't run repeated trials because it happened (or didn't)  \n",
