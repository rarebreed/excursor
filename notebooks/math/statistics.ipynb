    "A very important PMF is the binomial distribution.  It is used to calculate the probability of a certain number of\n",
    "outcomes.  The outcomes can only have two possible states: it happened, or it didn't happen (hence the binomial).  For  \n",

    "- n = 4 because we have 4 attempts\n",

    "- k = 3 because we want 3 out of 5\n",
    "- n = 5 because we are rolling 5 dice\n",
    "- p = 3/10 since P(8+ on 1d10) = P(8 on 1d10) + P(9 on 1d10) + P(10 on 1d10) = 1/10 + 1/10 + 1/10\n",
