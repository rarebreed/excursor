    "## Why Python\n",
    "\n",
    "So why am I doing this?  I want to show you how python is becoming a very important language and is challenging the reigning kings\n",
    "in several domains.  It would behoove every engineer to learn this language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is becoming a universal language for all domains\n",
    "- Machine Learning, Machine Learning, Machine Learning (did I say Machine Learning?)\n",
    "- notebooks for data analytics, business reporting, visualization and general experimentation\n",
    "- Big Data\n",
    "- serverless\n",
    "- statistical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Universal Language\n",
    "\n",
    "I used to believe there were 3 languages every engineer should learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- typescript: for the web world\n",
    "- python: for automation and science (including data science/machine learning)\n",
    "- rust: for low-level \"run anywhere\" (including the OS and embedded)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things have changed though.  Webassembly is becoming more mature all the time, and the possibility of compiling python to wasm is already here in limited form, thus making it not really necessary to learn typescript/javascript (other than working on legacy code).  The second is the upcoming language Mojo, which aims to be a systems programming language specialized for Machine Learning.  Like rust or C, it will have no garbage collector (if pure mojo code), but at the same time, it will be a superset of the python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning (it's coming...maybe for us)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the rise of Machine Learning, python has become an extremely important language.  Whether you like python or not, it is the lingua franca of Machine Learning.  Modular, the company creating mojo, is creating it because all of their customers said the python language was a non-negotiable deal. And also like it or not, as engineers, we seriously have to consider how AI will change how and what we do.  Will AI eventually replace our jobs or just become helpers for us?    I therefore think it is very important to become good at python for this reason alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat related to machine learning is the rise of _notebooks_.  Heavily used as experimental tools by data scientists, but also for analytics querying and reporting for BI.  Some even propose that notebooks are better than dashboards by proprietary vendors (eg, New Relic, Data Dog, Splunk, Kibbana, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons notebooks with python is so nice is because the python language is simple enough to execute code in the REPL (read-eval-print-loop for you non-lispers).  Unlike a traditional REPL, a notebook saves the code, and lets you rerun the code in the cell.  This makes it ideal for exploratory code and debugging.  This is a big reason almost all data scientists use it, but it is also ideal for ad-hoc exploratory testing, or running just a part of the code (as opposed to writing a script where you have to execute the script from the beginning.  Thus, python is an ideal candidate for QA teams, because regression suites are only half the battle.  But it's also good for experimenting to create unit tests too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serverless\n",
    "\n",
    "Another trend is serverless where execution time has become important and VM warmup is an issue.  Python import times can be just as bad as VM cold starts, so some care and profiling still needs to be done.  The rise of serverless has caused a big dent in the Java ecosystem, and is a reason Oracle has been working on their Graal technology to make native code that doesn't run on a JVM.  It's also been the fuel for languages like rust, go and swift...native machine executable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If/when mojo become available publicly, this is also something to keep an eye on for serverless architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, also related to machine learning, is how we will need to start testing applications that use Machine Learning.  Since AI apps give non-deterministic answers (during training, and possibly during inference depending on the model), you will need to use statistical analysis to test your models or the app using AI.  Python tools like numpy, pytorch, scipy, sympy are the industry standards (R and julia have a small share, but have been slowly dwindling)."
