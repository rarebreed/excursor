    "## Using async to boost IO performance\n",
    "\n",
    "An extremely common task is downloading something, typically from a web service or S3.  This is a great example of an\n",
    "IO bound task.  Generally speaking, a task (a function call or group of related function calls) can be thought of as\n",
    "either IO or CPU bound.  An IO bound task spends the majority of it's time doing some kind of IO work; downloading a \n",
    "file, waiting for an HTTP response, reading or writing a file on disk, etc etc.  A CPU bound spends the majority of its\n",
    "time in a CPU intensive task; calculating a matrix multiplication, sorting a large data structure based on some\n",
    "predicate, or some other calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why is an IO bound task _bound_?  What does it mean to be _bound_?  In most libraries and frameworks (including the\n",
    "standard library of the programming language) they use _synchronous_ IO methods.  What that means is that when you make\n",
    "a call for some IO related function (eg, reading from disk, making a network send call, etc) your code _blocks_ until\n",
    "there is a response back.  This response may come from your own system, such as when you read from disk, or from a \n",
    "remote computer, such as when you make an HTTP GET request.  Basically your code (technically, the CPU) has to wait\n",
    "until it receives a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to this are _async_ IO methods.  Under the hood, they use a different set of OS system calls that are\n",
    "**not** blocking.  Instead, these IO calls return immediately.  From this point, how the high level async library, the\n",
    "programming language it is written in and the low-level OS calls interact is highly variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, javascript uses the notion of a `Promise` to indicate that it promises that an answer will _eventually_\n",
    "be available (even if the answer is `null` or `undefined`).  Java uses a `Future` and rust also uses a `Future` except\n",
    "that a rust `Future` is implemented very differently from a Java one.  In python, it too has a `Future` and a `Task`\n",
    "and these represent the concept that eventually, you will get an answer from the async method.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can this be faster than multithreading at times?  Even if python did not have a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), using\n",
    "multiple threads is not a good solution for many IO bound tasks.  The classic example of this (and what led to async\n",
    "becoming a huge requirement...even to the creation of the node language) is the 10k problem.  Basically, this was the\n",
    "problem of a web service trying to handle 10k+ simultaneous connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your service becomes very popular, it may take more than a single computer to handle all the requests.  There's a\n",
    "bit of hidden complexity in the term _handle_.  There's actually two parts to this: \n",
    "\n",
    "- accepting the request, including any parameters, and sending some kind of request back to the caller\n",
    "- doing the work that was specified in the request (eg, performing a query, downloading a resource, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen from _handling_ a request, if part 1 is acknowledging the request, extracting the parameters, and returning\n",
    "something back to the caller, we have 2 choices.  The service \n"
