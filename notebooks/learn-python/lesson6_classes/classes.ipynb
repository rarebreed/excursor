    "a class may only extend one class, but implement many interfaces. Not only does it support true multiple inheritance,  \n",
    "but it also has a different form of subtyping than traditional OOP languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Users of other languages sometimes get confused about how to implement OOP in python because it doesn't have   \n",
    "> interfaces, traits or typeclasses.  Also, the infamous \"duck typing\" has a formal type equivalent called structural  \n",
