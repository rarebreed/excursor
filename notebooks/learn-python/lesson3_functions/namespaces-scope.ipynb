    "This will be a very brief intro, but hopefully even people using python will learn a thing or two here.  The first thing\n",
    "we will go over is the concept of `scopes`.  Python, unlike most modern languages is not lexically scoped.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What does `lexically scoped` mean?  Lexical means essentially, words, but it has to do with \"boundaries\" of your code.\n",
    "> In many languages with curly braces, the braces define a scope.  Variables or other symbols introduced in that scope\n",
    "> (eg the curly braces) only last inside the brace section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is not like that.  Indentation does **not** create a new scope in python, they do however _bind_ a `symbol`. So\n",
    "we need to discuss what symbols are, and how they are mapped in `namespaces`.\n",
