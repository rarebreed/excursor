    "Python functions have several special abilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can take default values for parameters\n",
    "- Can specify keyword at the calling of a function\n",
    "- Can take positional only parameters using `/`\n",
    "- Can take keyword only parameters using `*`\n",
    "- Can pass in a list for positional args with the `*identifier` (typically `*args`) operator\n",
    "    - If specified, must come before the `*` marker\n",
    "- Can pass in a dictionary for keyword args using the `**identifier` (typically `**kwargs`) operator\n",
    "    - if `*args` is used, must come after it\n",
    "\n",
    "All these rules can make it pretty complicated pretty fast.  I recommend sticking to a subset of these.  It is often\n",
