    "        - Namespace packages can omit `__init__`, because you can spread the package across multiple directories\n",
    "            - This is useful for example, to define _plugins_\n",
    "        - When a module in a _package_ is imported, it will execute any code in the `__init__` file (if any)\n",
    "            - It will execute this only once even if multiple modules are imported\n",
