    "- Can take positional only parameters using `/`\n",
    "- Can take keyword only parameters using `*`\n",
    "- Can pass in a list for positional args with the `*indentifier` (typically `*args`) operator\n",
    "    - If specified, must come before the `*` marker\n",
    "- Can pass in a dictionary for keyword args using the `**identifier` (typically `**kwargs`) operator\n",
    "    - if `*args` is used, must come after it\n",

    "All these rules can make it pretty complicated pretty fast.  I recommend sticking to a subset of these.  It is often\n",

As an aside, python distinguishes parameters vs. arguments.  Parameters are the _declaration_ of the types in the function, and arguments are the values passed in to the function when it is called."
