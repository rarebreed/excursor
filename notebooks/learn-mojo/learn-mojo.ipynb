    "# Mojo notes\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes will be in md format until the mojo SDK is released in September.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is currently written for readers who already have experience with a programming language, so it will not\n",
    "start from first principles.  There will be frequent references to rust, but it is not required to know rust.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will also be frequent comparisons to python, since mojo aims to be a superset of python (it is not close to this\n",
    "yet however).  Therefore, ideally, you should know python as well.  However, this is also not strictly necessary, and\n",
    "overtime, I will write the document to teach both python and mojo basics as mojo gains more compatibility with python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some limitations to note in mojo\n",
    "\n",
    "While mojo aims to be a superset of python, it is not yet there.  Some current limitations are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No top-level variables (ie, variables that don't live inside a function or struct)\n",
    "- No python `class` type (but it does have `struct` which is the non-dynamic version of a class)\n",
    "- The SDK to run locally is only available on x86_64 for linux (ubuntu)\n",
    "- `def` is not fully equivalent to python's def yet (eg, mojo's scope is different)\n",
    "- See [proposal on dynamism](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/main/proposals/mojo-and-dynamism.md) for more\n",
    "  details on mojo's lack of dynamism\n",
    "- Keyword arguments in mojo do not work (so you can't pass them to python either)\n",
    "    - This also means dict unpacking does not work (eg **kwargs, or *args for that matter)\n",
    "- For a more thorough list, see the [Roadmap and Rough Edges] documentation"

    "## Functions in Mojo\n",
    "\n",
    "The bread and butter of almost all languages (java being a lonely outlier) are functions, and mojo is no exception.  In mojo,\n",
    "there are two ways to define a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- like python with `def`\n",
    "- or with `fn`\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Parameter vs Argument**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Many languages treat parameters and arguments as synonyms, but mojo has a more precise definition.  A parameter is what is in\n",
    "> the declaration of the function and is therefore compile time.  An argument is the runtime type/value that gets passed into\n",
    "> the function when it is called, and is therefore known at runtime.  This dovetails nicely with mojo's Parameterized Expressions\n",
    "> which are like generics and functions that can run at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If using a `def` definition, type annotations for are not required (though still recommended) for a function's parameters or in the\n",
    "body of the function.  If using a `fn` definition, then the type annotations are required both for parameters, and for any locally\n",
    "declared variables in the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mojo uses a slightly modified version of the PEP-695 syntax (forthcoming in python 3.12 due out in early October 2023).  Unlike\n",
    "python type annotations where the return type can be inferred, in mojo, you must still specify the return type if using `fn` \n",
    "definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Async**: Mojo also has support for `async fn` and `async def` as well, along with the `await` keyword.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Argument passing\n",
    "\n",
    "Some programmers may not even understand what _argument passing_ means.  Some languages have only one way to do it, like\n",
    "python.  Or it may have something awkward like java (which differentiates between Objects and primitives) and do\n",
    "Boxing and Unboxing when the arguments are primitives, thereby causing a performance hit.  And since (Un)Boxing is \n",
    "implicit, it is not obvious that there are different ways to pass args to java methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you are not familiar with the terms, there are generally two different kinds of argument passing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- by value: (sometimes called by-copy) where the value of a variable is used\n",
    "- by reference: where the value is indirectly retrieved through reference or pointer dereferencing\n",
    "\n",
    "This is sometimes confusing to people, because pointers or references can be hard to conceptualize.  If it helps, think\n",
    "about _value equality_ versus _identity equality_ which is what Java does.  By default, in java, the `==` operator\n",
    "compares _identity equality_, meaning \"does this variable point to the same memory as this other variable?\".  But 95% of\n",
    "the time what we care about is _value equality_, or \"does this variable have the same contents of this other variable?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, a brief discussion of `ownership` needs to be mentioned.  Similarly to rust, mojo has a concept of ownership which\n",
    "basically just means \"who is responsible for cleaning up this data?\".  In languages without Garbage Collectors, this is\n",
    "very important (and is what C and C++ lack).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Mojo Update**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> There is some discussion on whether to rename some keywords. Notably `borrowed` may become `ref` and `inout` might\n",
    "> become `refmut`.  This is due to some changes they may need to make for `lifetimes`.  Also, they will probably change\n",
    "> they keywords to _modify the type_ rather than modify the parameter _name_.  For example:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> # Current way\n",
    "> fm modify_employee(inout employee: Employee): ...\n",
    "> # Proposed way\n",
    "> fn modify_employee(employee: refmut Employee): ...\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In mojo, by default, all parameters are immutable and passed by reference (an implicit keyword `borrowed` is added as a \n",
    "prefix to the parameter name so that `foo(borrowed age: Int)` and `foo(age: Int)` are equivalent). However, there are \n",
    "several ways to pass arguments to functions in mojo. An argument to a function can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **moved**: (aka _transferred_) where the ownership and _value_ of the argument is transferred to the function\n",
    "- **by reference (immutably)**: where a shared reference to the argument object is passed in \n",
    "- **by reference (mutably)**: where an exclusive mutable reference to the argument object is passed in\n",

    "### Pass by value: Move\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call a function with pass-by-value through move semantics.  Rather than copying the variable's data into the\n",
    "function, the data is transferred (ie, _moved_) from the variable into the called function.  This means that after the\n",
    "function is done, the original variable can't be used.\n",

    "- The type of the parameter must have a `__moveinit__` method defined\n",
    "- In the fn declaration, the parameter name will be prefixed with `owned` keyword\n",
    "- On the caller side, the argument is postfixed with the `^` symbol (eg `foo(age^)`)\n",
    "- Once moved, the original variable is no longer accessible (technically, it could be zeroed out but cant be reached)\n",
    "- _moves_ also happen in assignment, when the RHS variable is post-fixed with the `^` sigil (`let obj2 = obj1^`)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Comparison: Rust Move\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note that the default behavior is opposite to rust.  In rust, the default is to pass by value and to _move_ it (the\n",
    "> data is transferred and then once out of scope is gone).  Mojo takes the stand that it is more common to want to pass\n",
    "> by (immutable) reference and makes this the default.  This is also more similar to how python works, although most\n",
    "> things in python are a mutable pass by reference (eg, lists, dicts, and most classes). You therefore do not need to\n",
    "> mark the argument with a sigil (like `&foo`) that rust requires when you _do_ want to pass by immutable reference\n",
